Pomotreno is a Pomodoro timer application that runs entirely in your browser. It's designed to be a simple, yet powerful tool to help you stay focused and manage your time effectively. The core feature of Pomotreno is its use of the Picture-in-Picture API to provide an always-visible timer, so you can keep track of your work sessions without having to switch back and forth between tabs.

All your data is stored locally in your browser, ensuring your privacy. Pomotreno also keeps a log of your completed Pomodoro sessions, allowing you to track your productivity over time.
